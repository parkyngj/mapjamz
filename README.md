Don't know what to listen to? Find out what's popular in countries that you'd most like to travel to using MapJamz!

MapJamz is music discovery app to search weekly top tracks by country. The background dynamically changes as searches are made, and returned tracks can be streamed in-app.

## Usage

## About MapJamz

This project was initially completed in my 6th week at Dev Bootcamp, and was built using Ruby, Sinatra, JavaScript (jQuery and AJAX). I used the Last.fm, Google Maps, and YouTube APIs.

Since then, MapJamz has grown to more accurately reflect track rankings of certain countries, such as South Korea. For this, the Melon API was integrated (thanks Zino!).
